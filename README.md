### __Customizable Discord Theme__

#### How to use:
* Set discord appearance to Dark and Cozy.
* [Install Better Discord](https://betterdiscord.net/home/).
* Turn on transparency in BTD settings. 
> Transparency tends to get stuck on off. If after installing theme you by default don't have a transparent discord full restart discord from task bar while the setting is *off* and after restart turn it *on* followed by another full restart from task bar.
* Download '*[Customizable Theme.theme.css & Root.txt](https://github.com/kazquer/CustomizableTheme)*'.
* Place '*Customizable Theme.theme.css*' in BTD themes folder. 
* Copy code from inside '*Root.txt*' and paste it into BTD '*Custom CSS*' tab. 
* *'Save'* and '*Update*' the code in the same tab. (You need to do this every time you make a change to the values.)

Your are finished. You can go to themes settings and turn on the theme.

All changes possible are found in *'Custom CSS'* tab.
